HTML & CSS

This was a project for freeCodeCamp.org. Aside from having to meet the benchmarks set forth in the assignment, I was particularly challenged by the creation of the fixed nav menu and the need for the links to scroll to each section with enough margin to keep from cutting off the top of the section. I figured out how to do both of those things, and still use those methods in my current projects when needed.
